# Example and how-to files for some common [config] files

## How to use these files

There are two types of files name.example and name.howto where name is the original name of the config file to which this file belongs (like .gitignore.howto).

What they mean:

- **name.example**: contains some sample contents that will/may be useful and can be used as-is or be edited. It also usually contains a lot of commented lines for optional lines that can be commented in as necessary.
- **name.howto**: contains comments only which explain how to use the config file. This is intended to be usable as a new plain config file with directions for your collaborators as to how to use the file.
